		 There is a fully operational medical facility at the FOB. Simply move the yourself or the wounded next to the stretcher, and use the action in to initiate medical treatment. This will fully heal the unit. The unit selected for treatment will be the closest unit to the stretcher.

		<br />
		 We are to push forward and advance the front in Takistan. So far only minor engagements have ensued between special forces and wandering Takistani patrols... However with the enemy realising the full might of allied forces are on route, they are now retreating and consolidating their forces. Unfortunately, they are destroying the oil fields on their way.<br /><br />Your mission is to move to move out from <marker name=""TOUR_mkrFOB"">Camp Whitford</marker> and secure the <marker name=""TOUR_mkrAO"">oil field</marker> located near an <marker name=""TOUR_mkrDanger"">airbase</marker> close to Rasman.
		<br />
		<br />
		<br />
		<font size='20' align='center' color='#0080ff'>Intel</font>
		<br />
		<br />
		 Intelligence gained from Delta Team's working in the area, indicate high activity in the <marker name=""TOUR_mkrAO"">oil field</marker>, as the Takistani Army in this region fall back to the nearby <marker name=""TOUR_mkrDanger"">airbase</marker>. We now have intel suggesting they have been planting charges over the oilfield, and are planning to destroy it.<br /><br />The local Delta Team has been despatched to your squad along with an attachment of vehicles (HMMWV x3, MTVR x2, AH-6J), a pilot, and most importantly an EOD team.<br /><br />Expect mainly infantry, with possible technicals and the chance of heavy armoured vehicles. Make sure you stay clear of the occupied <marker name=""TOUR_mkrDanger"">airbase</marker>, which is heavily defended against ground and air assaults.<br /><br />Haste is of importance, we believe the bombs will be detonated within the next hour or two.
		<br/>

		<br/>
		<font size='20' align='center' color='#0080ff'>Explosives Information</font>
		<br />
		<br />		
		Your EOD team is important to the mission. If they are lost, you will find it difficult and highly dangerous to defuse bombs. It is highly recommended that should you not attempt to defuse a suspected explosive device, unless you are a trained for it.<br /><br />Defusal of an explosive device can be done by working out a sequence of 8 arrows. If the sequence is wrong, your will have to start again, and remember the progress you had made. Read the Bomb Defusal section of your notes on how to defuse the explosive device.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>		
		<font size='20' align='center' color='#0080ff'>Support</font>
		<br />
		<br />
		 You are advancing beyond enemy lines, therefore there is no local support within the area.
		<br />
		<br />
		Ground vehicles can be repaired by driving to the <marker name=""TOUR_mkrVeh"">service area</marker>, as can the Little Bird at its <marker name=""TOUR_mkrHeli"">landing pad</marker>. Turn of the engine, and the service crews will come and assist, rearming and repairing the vehicle or aircraft.
